# DISProj
# About
Our DIS project is a website called "BuildALaunch" that runs on Flask, Python and
SQL. Everyone knows the concept of Build-A-Bear, our website "BuildALaunch" resembles this concept and brings it to another level.
The user can, so to say, build a launch from scratch. The website provides the user with different options to choose from companies, rockets, and locations. Remember to make your choices wisely because every decision has consequences...
